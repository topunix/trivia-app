# Full Stack Trivia API Frontend

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman or curl, update the endpoints in the frontend, and then the frontend should integrate smoothly.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This app depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing project dependencies

This app uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```

## Request Formatting

The frontend should be fairly straightforward and disgestible. You'll primarily work within the ```components``` folder in order to edit the endpoints utilized by the components. While working on your backend request handling and response formatting, you can reference the frontend to view how it parses the responses. 

After you complete your endpoints, ensure you return to and update the frontend to make request and handle responses appropriately: 
- Correct endpoints
- Update response body handling 

## Styling

In addition, you may want to customize and style the frontend by editing the CSS in the ```stylesheets``` folder.
